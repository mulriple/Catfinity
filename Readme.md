Who doesn't love cats? This shows an infinite wall of cats from [placekitten.com](http://placekitten.com/) and was inspired by [Wall of Sound](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wall-of-sound/id468873601?mt=8).

## Todo

1. Make enqueueing of image loads take into account scrolling, we shouldn't start web requests when scrolling because they back up quickly.
2. Add infinite scroll effect to make the wall look truly infinite
3. Add about in Settings.app
4. Investigate simply putting all of the images into the bundle in a .zip
5. Put on App Storeâ€¦
6. Make tapping a cat do something
